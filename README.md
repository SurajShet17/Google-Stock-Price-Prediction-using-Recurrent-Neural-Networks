# Google-Stock-Price-Prediction-using-Recurrent-Neural-Networks
Predicting stock prices is a challenging task due to the inherent complexity and volatility of financial markets. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), a type of deep learning model, have shown promise in capturing temporal dependencies and making accurate predictions.When applied to predicting the Google stock exchange price, RNNs can leverage historical data to forecast future price movements.

To predict the Google stock exchange price using RNNs, a dataset of historical price data, along with relevant features such as trading volume and market sentiment, is collected. The dataset is then divided into training and testing sets, with the training set used to train the RNN.

The architecture of the RNN typically consists of recurrent layers, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layers, which are capable of modeling sequential information. These layers allow the RNN to capture dependencies in the historical price data and make predictions based on the patterns observed.

During the training phase, the RNN learns to map the historical price data to the corresponding future prices. This is achieved by minimizing a loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted prices and the actual prices. The RNN's weights and biases are updated using backpropagation through time, allowing it to adjust its internal representations and make increasingly accurate predictions.

Various techniques can enhance the performance of the RNN model. These include feature scaling to normalize the input data, regularization methods to prevent overfitting, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's architecture and learning parameters.

Once trained, the RNN is evaluated on the testing set to assess its predictive accuracy. The model generates predictions for future price movements based on the input historical data. These predictions can help investors and traders make informed decisions and manage risks.

It's important to note that stock market prediction is inherently challenging and subject to various uncertainties and external factors. While RNNs can provide valuable insights, they should be used as a tool for analysis rather than as the sole basis for making financial decisions.
